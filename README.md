# slipshow README

This is a VS Code extension to write, preview and compile [slipshow](https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow/) presentations.

## Features

The extension currently has two commands:

- "Preview Slipshow", which previews the presentation in a separate panel, and
- "Compile Slipshow", which compiles the presentation in an html file of the same name.

## Warnings

This is still in early phase.
